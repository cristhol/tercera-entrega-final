                    keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen and singer Tarja Turunen, all of them high
                    school classmates. Nightwish's music is heavily inspired by music. of cinema, literature, feelings
                    and Nordic folklore. Furthermore, Holopainen revealed that before forming the band he was inspired
                    by Stratovarius.</P>

            <p class="lead"> The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami V채nsk채 after the
                release of their debut album, Angels Fall First (1997). In 2001, V채nsk채 was replaced by Marko Hietala,
                who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. <br>

                Although Nightwish have been prominent in their home country since Angels Fall First, they did not
                achieve wider success until the release of the albums Oceanborn (1998), Wishmaster (2000) and
                Century Child (2002). Their 2004 album, Once, has sold more than one million copies and was the
                band's breakthrough in the United States. Their biggest US hit single, <em> "Wish I Had an Angel"
                (2004)</em>, received MTV airplay and was included on three US film soundtracks to promote their
                North American tour.The band produced three more singles and two music videos for Once, as well as a
                re-recording of <em>"Sleeping Sun" </em> for the compilation album, Highest Hopes: The Best of
                Nightwish (2005), before Turunen's dismissal in October 2005. Her last performance with Nightwish
                was during a concert recorded for the live album/DVD End of an Era. After the concert, the other
                members informed Turunen with an open letter that she was no longer a member of Nightwish. <br>

                In May 2007, Nightwish announced Anette Olzon as Turunen's replacement. That September, the band
                released their sixth album, Dark Passion Play, which has sold almost 2 million copies. The album's
                lead single, <em>"Amaranth"</em>, became one of Nightwish's most successful in Europe. The
                supporting tour, one of the band's largest, started on October 6, 2007, and ended on September 19,
                2009. The band released an EP/live album, Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places), in March
                2009 as a CD/DVD, and their seventh studio album, Imaginaerum, was released globally on various days
                in late 2011/early 2012. <br>

                On October 1, 2012, Nightwish announced that they had parted ways with Olzon and would be finishing
                the tour with at that time ReVamp vocalist (ex-After Forever) Floor Jansen.
                In October 2013, Nightwish made Jansen and longtime session uilleann pipes player Troy Donockley
                permanent members of the band, and they were featured in the acclaimed album Endless Forms Most
                Beautiful, released on March 27, 2015. From 2014 to 2019, Nevalainen, while still a member of the
                band, was inactive due to severe insomnia issues; in July 2019, he announced that he would not be
                returning to the band, with Kai Hahto, who had acted as his replacement since 2014 (including by
                performing all drums on Endless Forms Most Beautiful), being promoted as the official drummer, and
                is featured as such at the ninth album, Human. :II: Nature., which was released internationally on
                April 10, 2020. After twenty years of performing with the band, it was announced that bassist Marko
                Hietala had parted ways with the band in January 2021. <br>

                Nightwish is the third-best-selling band and musical entity in Finland with certified sales of
                nearly 900,000 certified copies. The group is also the most successful Finnish band worldwide,
                selling more than 10 million records and receiving more than 60 gold and platinum awards, having
                released six Number 1 albums and thirteen Number 1 singles. On October 26, 2018, Nightwish was
                inducted into the Finnish Music Hall of Fame, becoming the honorary gallery's 11th member.</p>
